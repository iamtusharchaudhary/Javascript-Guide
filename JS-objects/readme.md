# JavaScript Objects

In JavaScript, an object is a data structure that allows you to store collections of key-value pairs. The keys are also known as properties or methods (if they hold functions), and the values can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, arrays, functions, or other objects. JavaScript objects are used to represent real-world entities and group related data or behavior together.
They serve as the foundational building blocks for modeling real-world entities and facilitating object-oriented programming by encapsulating data (properties) and actions (methods) in a single entity.

## JS objects methods:-
<ul>
  <li>Object.keys</li>
